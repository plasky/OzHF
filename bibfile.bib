abstract = {Large scale laser interferometric gravitational wave detectors (GWDs), such as GEO 600 require high quality optics to reach their design sensitivity. The inevitable surface imperfections, inhomogeneities, and light-absorption induced thermal lensing in the optics, can convert laser light from the fundamental mode to unwanted higher order modes, and pose challenges to the operation and sensitivity of the GWDs. Here we demonstrate the practical implementation of a thermal projection system which reduces those unwanted effects via targeted spatial heating of the optics. The thermal projector consists of 108 individually addressable heating elements which are imaged onto the beam splitter of GEO 600. We describe the optimization of the spatial heating profile and present the obtained results.},

The basis for this effect is the excitation of the additional (Stokes) optical mode with frequency Ï‰1 and of the mirror's elastic mode with frequency Ï‰m when the optical energy stored in the \{FP\} resonator main mode with frequency Ï‰0 exceeds the certain threshold and the frequencies are related as Ï‰0â‰ƒÏ‰1+Ï‰m. This effect is undesirable in laser gravitational wave antennae because it may create a specific upper limit for the value of energy stored in \{FP\} resonator. In order to avoid it the detailed analysis of the mirror's elastic modes and \{FP\} resonator optical modes structure is necessary. "

	abstract={Advanced LIGO and other ground-based interferometric gravitational-wave detectors use high laser power to minimize shot noise and suspended optics to reduce seismic noise coupling. This can result in an opto-mechanical coupling which can become unstable and saturate the interferometer control systems. The severity of these parametric instabilities scales with circulating laser power and first hindered LIGO operations in 2014. Static thermal tuning and active electrostatic damping have previously been used to control parametric instabilities at lower powers but are insufficient as power is increased. Here we report the first demonstration of dynamic thermal compensation to avoid parametric instability in an Advanced LIGO detector. Annular ring heaters that compensate central heating are used to tune the optical mode away from multiple problematic mirror resonance frequencies. We develop a single-cavity approximation model to simulate the optical beat note frequency during the central heating and ring heating transient. An experiment of dynamic ring heater tuning at the LIGO Livingston detector was carried out at 170 kW circulating power and, in agreement with our model, the third order optical beat note is controlled to avoid instability of the 15 and 15.5 kHz mechanical modes. We project that dynamic thermal compensation with ring heater input conditioning can be used in parallel with acoustic mode dampers to control the optical mode transient and avoid parametric instability of these modes up to Advanced LIGO's design circulating power of 750 kW. The experiment also demonstrates the use of three mode interaction monitoring as a sensor of the cavity geometry, used to maintain the g-factor product to g1g2= 0.829 Ã·/- 0.004.}

We derive new general relationships based upon practical considerations. Our analysis shows that if the fiber's MFD could be increased arbitrarily, 36 kW of power could be obtained with diffraction-limited quality from a fiber laser or amplifier. This power limit is determined by thermal and non-linear limits that combine to prevent further power scaling, irrespective of increases in mode size. However, limits to the scaling of the MFD may restrict fiber lasers to lower output powers.},
